#!/usr/bin/env bun
// Build a self-contained botmux single-file executable with `bun build --compile`.
// RUN WITH BUN (uses the programmatic Bun.build API + a build plugin):
//   bun scripts/build-bun-binary.mjs [--target bun-linux-x64] [--out <path>] [--all]
//
// WHY: botmux ships on npm and needs a specific Node runtime on PATH. Users with
// two Node versions installed end up with two competing global `botmux` installs
// that shadow each other and update independently. A single Bun-compiled binary
// bundles the runtime + all JS + native addons, so distribution becomes "download
// one file, run it" with no Node on the machine.
//
// THE HARD PART — native addons: `bun --compile` only auto-embeds a `.node` that
// is *statically* `require()`d. botmux's native deps load theirs via dynamic /
// relative paths that don't survive compilation, so we rewrite their loaders at
// build time via a Bun plugin (bun-native-embed-plugin.mjs):
//   • node-pty — VERIFIED end-to-end on linux-x64: the compiled binary spawns a
//     real PTY when run from a directory with no node_modules. On macOS node-pty
//     also needs a `spawn-helper` sidecar; linux uses forkpty() and does not.
//   • @napi-rs/canvas (card PNG rendering, non-critical) — honors
//     NAPI_RS_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH; handled by the runtime bootstrap the plugin
//     injects. Absent native → card render degrades, daemon still runs.
//
// PREREQ: `bun run build` first — this bundles from dist/ (the same artifact npm
// ships); it does NOT recompile TypeScript.
//
// MATRIX: --all cross-compiles darwin/linux × arm64/x64. Only the host-arch
// binary is smoke-tested locally; the rest are verified by CI on native runners
// (.github/workflows/release.yml `bun-binaries`). Windows is excluded — the
// daemon is Unix-only (PTY/tmux/pm2).

// The `-musl` variants exist because Alpine (and most slim Docker images) link
// against musl libc, where a glibc-linked binary does not run at all — it dies in
// the loader with an error that names no cause. npm selects the right one on its
// own: each platform subpackage declares `libc: ["musl"] | ["glibc"]` (undocumented
// in `npm help package-json` but live in the wild, e.g. @napi-rs/canvas ships both).
//
// ⚠️ A musl binary MUST be compiled on musl: `pty.node` is embedded at build time,
// and node-pty has no linux prebuild, so the builder compiles it against whatever
// libc it is running on (verified: glibc box → `NEEDED libc.so.6`, Alpine container
// → `NEEDED libc.musl-x86_64.so.1`). release.yml therefore runs the musl legs inside
// an Alpine container — cross-compiling them from a glibc runner would embed the
// wrong native and fail at PTY spawn, not at build time.

/**
 * The version to bake into the binary.
 *
 * WHY BAKE IT: every runtime version lookup ends at a `readFileSync` of the
 * install root's package.json (cli.ts `getVersion`, install-info
 * `botmuxVersionAt`). In compiled mode there IS no package.json on disk — the
 * module graph lives in the virtual read-only /$bunfs and `packageRoot()` walks
 * up to `/`, which has none. Every one of those reads fails, so `botmux
 * --version` printed `unknown` and the help banner read `botmux vunknown`.
 * Measured on the published canary before this fix.
 *
 * Compile time is the only place that knows the version for certain: release.yml
 * stamps package.json from the git tag BEFORE this script runs (the "Sync version
 * from git tag" step), so reading it here captures exactly what is being shipped.
 *
 * LOCAL VERIFICATION OVERRIDE: outside a release, package.json carries the
 * placeholder `0.0.0`, which the runtime deliberately treats as "not baked" (so a
 * local build cannot pass a placeholder off as authoritative). That makes the
 * smoke's version check fail on `unknown` for anyone compiling by hand — measured.
 * `scripts/verify-binary.mjs` therefore passes a `git describe` value through this
 * variable. It is read ONLY as a fallback, never over a real package.json version,
 * so it cannot influence a release build.

/**
 * Ad-hoc re-sign a compiled darwin binary, then verify it.
 *
 * WHY: `bun build --compile` ad-hoc-signs its own darwin output, but the signer
 * only gets the HOST arch right. On the macos-14 (arm64) release runner,
 * `--target=bun-darwin-x64` therefore lands an INVALID signature. Measured on
 * the v3.19.0 release run, where `codesign --verify --strict` reported:
 *
 *     botmux-darwin-arm64: valid on disk                                  ← native, fine
 *     botmux-darwin-x64: invalid signature (code or signature have been modified)
 *     In architecture: x86_64
 *
 * ...with bun 1.4.1 on the runner — i.e. AFTER the version bump this was
 * supposed to be fixed by. oven-sh/bun#39837 is titled "compile: fix invalid
 * ad-hoc code signature on darwin-arm64" and its test only compiles
 * `--target=bun-darwin-arm64`; nothing upstream covers x86_64. So bumping bun
 * again does NOT close this — don't read "we're on 1.4.2" as "already fixed".
 *
 * RE-MEASURED when the pin moved 1.4.1 → 1.4.2, by cross-compiling a two-line
 * hello-world from linux and recomputing the CodeDirectory page hashes (no
 * macOS required), with 1.4.0 as a control so the check is known to discriminate:
 *   1.4.0 → darwin-arm64: INVALID (1/15483)   darwin-x64: INVALID (2/17124)
 *   1.4.2 → darwin-arm64: VALID   (15075/15075)  darwin-x64: INVALID (2/16792, incl. slot 0)
 * So 1.4.2 changes nothing for the cross-compiled x64 cell: the arch-specific
 * defect is still there and this re-sign is still what makes the shipped
 * darwin-x64 binary runnable.
 * `codesign --force --sign -` is the re-signing fix confirmed in
 * oven-sh/bun#39764 (`BUN_NO_CODESIGN_MACHO_BINARY=1` and `--remove-signature`
 * were both reported there as NOT working).
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS: recent macOS SIGKILLs a bad-signature binary before `main()`,
 * so 3.18.14 shipped a darwin-x64 build that could not start at all — all
 * `botmux upgrade` saw was a dead process. Nothing caught it, because
 * release.yml's `Smoke-test the host-arch binary` runs only the host arch
 * (arm64), and the arm64 binary was always fine.
 *
 * Idempotent, so this runs for BOTH darwin targets rather than special-casing
 * x64: re-signing the already-valid native output just rewrites an equivalent
 * signature, and not depending on "which arch is currently broken upstream"
 * keeps this correct if the arch-conditional bug moves.
 *
 * Signing needs macOS (`codesign` is an Apple tool), so a darwin binary
 * cross-built from Linux stays unsigned — warn loudly rather than fail, since
 * release.yml builds darwin only on macOS while `--all` on a Linux dev box is a
 * legitimate workflow. This function establishes a structurally valid
 * preliminary signature. Stable releases replace it with the repository's
 * Developer ID identity in `sign-darwin-binaries`; prereleases keep it ad-hoc.
