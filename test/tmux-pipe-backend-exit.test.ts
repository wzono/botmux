/**
 * Regression: tearing down the fifo reader must not wedge process exit.
 *
 * THE BUG (production incident): TmuxPipeBackend opens its fifo O_RDWR and
 * reads it with a libuv threadpool read that is deliberately BLOCKING (see the
 * O_NONBLOCK rationale in spawn()). `readStream.destroy()` detaches the JS
 * stream but leaves that thread parked inside the kernel `read()`, and since we
 * hold the write end ourselves the read never sees EOF. `process.exit()` then
 * blocks forever in uv__threadpool_cleanup joining the thread — with the event
 * loop already stopped, so the process cannot self-kill on a timer. Every
 * worker of one daemon ended up stuck mid-exit; the daemon still believed they
 * were live and kept delivering turns, so every user message came back as
 * "Worker 未能接收这条消息" (worker.input_delivery_failed), permanently.
 *
 * WHY A CHILD PROCESS: the failure IS "the process never exits". Nothing
 * in-process can observe it — an in-test assertion would itself hang. So the
 * only honest probe is to spawn a real process and assert it terminates.
 *
 * WHY tmux IS FAKED: the production code targets the DEFAULT tmux socket,
 * shared with every live daemon on this machine. A fake `tmux` first on PATH
 * keeps the real fifo/read/teardown path intact while touching no real server.
