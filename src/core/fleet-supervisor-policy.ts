/**
 * Fleet supervisor — PURE policy layer (no process I/O, no fs, no timers).
 *
 * This is the safety core of the pm2 replacement: it encodes the invariants the
 * old pm2-* guard modules enforced, as pure functions over plain state so they
 * can be unit-tested exhaustively without spawning anything. The live supervisor
 * (fleet-supervisor.ts) owns spawn/kill/fs/timers and calls into here for every
 * decision.
 *
 * Invariants preserved from pm2 (see the design doc):
 *  1. graceful-exit suppresses restart — a child that exits with
 *     DAEMON_GRACEFUL_EXIT_CODE (90) shut down cleanly and must NOT be restarted;
 *     every other exit (including signal death, which surfaces as a non-90 code
 *     or a signal) is a crash and restarts, under a backoff, up to maxRestarts.
 *     The exit code alone is NOT proof the operator asked for the stop, so the
 *     live layer honours the sentinel only when IT initiated it (fleet-wide
 *     stopping flag / per-bot explicitStop set before the exit arrived); a 90
 *     that arrives without that intent is treated as a crash and restarted, so
 *     a stray signal from outside the supervision tree cannot permanently
 *     retire the fleet.
 *  2. max_restarts cap — after maxRestarts crash-restarts a proc is parked
 *     'errored' and left alone (no restart storm).
 *  3. projection identity — the fleet's proc set has unique names and no two
 *     live procs share a pid (a duplicate would mean we lost track of a child).
 *  4. idempotent start — starting a fleet that is already fully online is a
 *     no-op; only missing/stopped procs are (re)spawned.
 *  5. generation-safe addressing — every spawn bumps a monotonic generation, so
 *     a kill/exit is always matched to the exact (pid, generation) it targeted
 *     and can never act on a newer replacement child.
 * (Single-supervisor mutual exclusion (flock) and kill_timeout live in the live
 *  layer since they need fs/timers; this module provides the decisions they use.)
