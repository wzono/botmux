/**
 * Trigger-user CLI authentication policy.
 *
 * Default OFF. When a bot enables it, that bot's CLI calls out to `lark-cli` /
 * `bytedcli` run as **the person who sent the current message**, instead of
 * "whoever happens to be logged in on this machine".
 *
 * ## The rule this file encodes
 *
 * A CLI call uses the credentials of the current message's sender, or none.
 * The only permitted downgrade is "the bot's own tenant identity", which
 * belongs to nobody. Falling back to *another person's* login is never
 * allowed — not even the owner's. That is what the feature exists to remove,
 * so there is deliberately no config value that asks for it.
 *
 * Why no owner exception: the moment one exists, "whose permissions ran this?"
 * loses its single answer, and every credential lookup grows a branch. Those
 * bugs are silent — nothing errors, the audit trail just names the wrong
 * person.
 *
 * ## Why the two tools cannot share one rule
 *
 * `lark-cli` has a real non-human identity (app id + secret resolve
 * `identity: bot`), so most calls can degrade safely. `bytedcli` has only SSO
 * personal login — no service account, no AK/SK — so for it "unauthorized"
 * genuinely means "this command cannot run". `supportsBotIdentity` records that
 * asymmetry rather than pretending both tools behave alike.
 *
 * Both tools DO support per-person credentials, by different mechanisms: Lark
 * through an OAuth user token injected as env, ByteCloud through that person's
 * own `bytedcli` login kept in a private HOME (see services/bytedcli-auth.ts).
 * What differs is only the fallback when someone has not authorized.
 *
 * Whether a *particular* lark-cli command accepts `--as bot` is not decided
 * here: the CLI itself declares it (an unsupported one answers `--as bot is
 * not supported, this command only supports: user`). A hand-maintained list of
 * "commands needing a person" would go stale and grow holes.

 * user, so without the file sandbox it can simply read every token file in
 * `~/.botmux/data/`. The per-person storage still fixes attribution and the
 * overwrite bug, and the wrapper still injects only the current sender's
 * credentials; what is missing is any barrier against an agent that goes
 * looking on its own.
 *
 * With the sandbox on, the whole data dir is deny-by-default and only this
 * session's own identity file is granted — the boundary is then enforced by the
 * OS rather than by convention.
 *
 * Callers surface this so an operator can decide; it deliberately does not gate
 * the feature. Refusing to run without a sandbox would push people away from a
 * change that is an improvement either way, and claiming isolation we do not
 * have would be worse than both.
