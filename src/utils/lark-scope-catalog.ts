 * Worth validating against rather than trusting the caller: a misspelled scope
 * does not degrade gracefully. Feishu rejects the whole authorize URL with
 * 20043, so the person is handed a link that simply fails to open — with no
 * indication that one word in it was wrong. That has already happened here once
 * (commit 487e297d: a bare `docs:document.comment`, which is not a real scope).
 *
 * Names come from the same generated catalog `botmux setup` uses, so this stays
 * in step with the console rather than drifting as a hand-kept list.
